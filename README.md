# Understanding the Connections Between Sexual Violence and HIV

Research suggests that experiencing childhood sexual abuse and/or intimate partner violence increases a womanâ€™s risk of HIV infection, both directly through the abuse and indirectly through maladaptive coping strategies. This interactive project explains both pathways of HIV infection risk, and provides recommendations and additional resources for health and allied health professionals who work with women.
